# Philosophy-Big-Wigs
Web Scraping project to find out who the most quoted Philosopher on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is.

## Top 10 Cited Philosophers
See the file 'Top 10 Philosophers' for quick reference.

## Some Limitations of the project
- The analysis cannot distinguish between references to different people who share the same surname, e.g. John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill.
- The analysis does not accurately parse the last names of Chinese philosophers, whose last names come first.
- The analysis does not accurately parse the last names of certain French (and perhaps Spanish) philosophers whose last names can be two words, e.g. "du Man"
- The analysis does not distinguish between occurances of a last name from common words where the two are identical, for instance distinguishing "Law" in "William Law" and "The rule of Law".
